# flask-boilerplate
WIP for a basic flask boilerplate project. The aim is to have, eventually:
- SQLAlchemy and migration support;
- Basic login, password recovery and email confirmation;
- Using a modern CSS framework;
- Some kind of queue processing, maybe using huey;
- Asset building pipeline (to be considered).

Every packaged functionality will have automated tests.
